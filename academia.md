# academia

So I am going to graudet school. this project is to streamline many challenges education faces, for creating a consistent and central workspace for any academic endeaver.
goals:
reduce the budget for educatiion significantly
reduce toil, paperworks, and all other redundant stuff
reduce professor time for creating stuff , such as presentation, text exams etc..
make education accsissble and available
student can focus on learning, while teacher can focuson ideas and teaching stuff
rather than most of their time be spent to create those teaching materials
collaboration and problem solving
more time for scientfic research and advancement and excting projects
rather those stupid so called real world hands on which usaulyl add zero values to the world.
great for conducting interviews , surveys and all other data to udnerstand what academia is really need rather than poor estimation, which create a current poor academic values.
student are prepared for life and career and independet workflows.

- scientifc writing and writing workshop included.
- english as second langauge included.

ideas:

Draft/ proposal:

1. Library: since most academia provide access to digital libraries, its a good idea, so our app can have access to the book for the course, so for every session pages can be accociated. comments can be made, and discussuon can be online. highlights can be done
   and clarfication can be made. this way student can focus on learning, rather doig all of this stuff themself. and because of our expericen understanding how intellginet work, giving example to student is much better way to teach them these skills, rather than abstraction.

2. available to translator, to translate sicence into other lagnauges, which is peer reviewed. and gives an oppurtunity to fine tune a model, which can be later be used for automating these processes!
